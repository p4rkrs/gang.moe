This canary should be updated on the first of every month, but due to laziness could be delayed by up to a week. Failure to update this canary does not mean cock.li has received a gag order, nor is not updating it or omitting anything an attempt to communicate anything to anyone. This canary serves only to periodically confrim certain facts as long as they are true.
